## Features
#### 1. Home Automation & Integration with Other Smart Devices
A mobile app that communicates with the NodeMCU (ESP-8266) which controls Relay driver over Wi-Fi. This app can provide users with a user-friendly interface to control the bulb's on/off status and other features. We can integrate it with smart thermostats, door sensors, or security cameras to create a more comprehensive smart home experience.

#### 2. Real Time monitoring
The smart Iot system provides the real time monitoring by updating the number of persons present in the room. It collect the data record and send it to the web application that can be further process. the desktop app ensures a consistent experience.

#### 3. Scheduler and Automation
We have implemented a scheduling system to allow users to set specific times for the invisible smart bulb to turn on/off or change its behavior. This enhances automation and can be useful for energy conservation.

#### 4. Security Features 
We use the laser and motion sensors to implement security features. For instance, the smart bulb could detect intruders or unexpected movements and send notifications to the user's smartphone.
Robust security measures and communication protocols guarantee a safe and reliable control mechanism

#### 5. Mobile App or desktop app Control 
Revolutionizing appliance control, our IoT system introduces an effortlessly intuitive mobile app and desktop interface allowing users to seamlessly control the electrical appliances by using only their mobile phones with a user friendly interface without moving any step. This helps reducing the use of the traditional board switch.

#### 6. Additional Features 
Enhancing the smart control experience, our IoT system integrates additional features to optimize energy efficiency and provide real-time insights into the current room temperature. The system prioritizes sustainability by allowing users to monitor and regulate energy consumption, contributing to a greener and more eco-conscious lifestyle
